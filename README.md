Kaggle Lux AI - Gather the most resources and survive the night!


## Introduction

The night is dark and full of terrors. Two teams must fight off the darkness, collect resources, and advance through the ages. Daytime finds a desperate rush to gather the resources that can carry you through the impending night whilst growing your city. Plan and expand carefully -- any city that fails to produce enough light will be consumed by darkness.
